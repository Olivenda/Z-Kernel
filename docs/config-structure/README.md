# Configuration Layout Sketch

This folder mirrors a subset of the requested kernel-style configuration categories. Only a few highlighted areas are represented to keep the structure focused on priorities rather than every possible menu item.

- `general-system-configuration/` – top-level bucket for core system configuration areas.
  - `device-drivers/` – placeholder for driver-related configuration snippets and notes.
  - `filesystem-support/` – placeholder for filesystem-centric configuration materials.
  - `networking-support/` – placeholder for network-related configuration materials.

Add files to these folders as the configuration details solidify.
