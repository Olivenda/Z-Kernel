# Configuration Layout Sketch

This folder mirrors a subset of the requested kernel-style configuration categories. Only a few highlighted areas are represented to keep the structure focused on priorities rather than every possible menu item.

- `general-system-configuration/` – top-level bucket for core system configuration areas.
  - `cpu-and-architecture-options/` – processor-centric toggles like language choice and paging.
  - `memory-and-ram-options/` – memory map logging, heap demos, and test patterns.
  - `power-management-acpi/` – ACPI and suspend/resume placeholders.
  - `filesystem-support/` – filesystem-centric configuration materials including ramfs/ext stubs.
  - `networking-support/` – core networking entries plus the diagnostic tool stack.
  - `security-hardening-tools/` – firewall, IDS, sandbox, and crypto helper stubs.
  - `debugging-profiling-logging/` – debug symbols, tracing, and panic simulation helpers.
  - `virtualization-containers/` – container helpers and virtualization toggles.
  - `hardware-utilities-sensors/` – CPU sensors, fan control, and thermal calibration placeholders.
  - `bootloader-firmware-options/` – serial, keyboard, and framebuffer boot-time settings.
  - `userland-tools/` – service utilities, log collectors, and rescue shell notes.

Add files to these folders as the configuration details solidify.
